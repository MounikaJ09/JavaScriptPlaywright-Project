 //Identifiers are the names given to variables, functions, classes, etc. They must follow certain rules:
// 1. They must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
// 2. They can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), underscores, or dollar signs.
// 3. They cannot be a reserved keyword (like 'var', 'function', 'class', etc.).
// 4. They are case-sensitive (e.g., 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' are different identifiers).  
// Examples of valid identifiers:
let myVariable = 10;
const _myConstant = 20;     
function myFunction() {
    // function body
}       
//Lierals are fixed values that are directly represented in the code. They can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc. Examples of literals:
let numberLiteral = 42; 
let stringLiteral = "Hello, World!";
let booleanLiteral = true;      
//Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. They can be arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, etc. Examples of operators:
let sum = 5 + 3; // Arithmetic operator
let isEqual = (5 === 3); // Comparison operator
let isTrue = (true && false); // Logical operator       
//Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning in the programming language. They cannot be used as identifiers. Examples of keywords:
let if = 10; // Invalid, 'if' is a keyword
function for() { // Invalid, 'for' is a keyword
    // function body
}
